    "bio": "Most of the issues faced by African countries will be resolved by utilizing technology. Software Engineers will be central in this process. This realization and the desire to take part in a personal rebirth to mirror the renascence of Africa, prompted me to pursue a career in Software Engineering. I am privileged to hold executive leadership positions in the education sector as well as to have experience as a licensed commercial pilot. My approach as a developer is heavily influenced by my skills gained as a leader and pilot as well as my unique perspective as a third-culture individual. I approach each story in the Agile Methodology with the end user in mind. My go-to technology is the MERN stack, though I am by no means limited to these technologies. I am a lifelong learner and I find joy in learning new paths to solutions.",
